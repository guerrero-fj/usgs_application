Hiring Committee
USGS Data Science
Interdisciplinary Data Scientist GS-11/12/13

Dear members of the hiring committee, 

Please consider me for the Interdisciplinary Data Scientist position(s) in your Cluster Hire process. I would like to address two aspects of my application: 1-professional interest in the Water Mission Area (WMA) and 2-eligibility for the position as a person lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residency and seeking citizenship.

For almost five years, I have followed the progress and advances led by the WMA. As a water modeler and science communicator, their efforts to expand access to water data across the nation have been an inspiration to me. After inviting Dr. Emily Read to participate in the first panel on Strategic Communication of Open Science in 2021, I learned more about the WMA during our subsequent discussions. 

Due to my academic and professional experiences, I am an interdisciplinary water resources scientist. Throughout my 20-year career, I have gained a wide range of experience. By combining mathematics, physics, chemistry, and statistical analysis, my work seeks to understand how watersheds across the U.S. will respond to disturbances, including those triggered more prematurely by climate change -- a major factor influencing water quality and quantity. 

My background includes scientific journalism for CNN Espanol and a parallel career in science communication. Currently, I am seeking to leverage technical coding skills and strategic communication tactics to build open and reproducible workflows for both science and science communication. WMA's ambitious plans will lead to very important discussions at the USGS regarding modernization. The ability to facilitate conversations about cultural change across an organization is one of my strengths. 

The job advertisement specifies that candidates must be U.S. citizens. But it also states that "Agencies are permitted to hire non-citizens in very limited circumstances where there are no qualified citizens available for the position." I have decided to apply because there is a very strong match between my skills and the range of positions you have opened through the cluster hire. 

Sincerely,

Francisco J. Guerrero
