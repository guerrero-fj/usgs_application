### Position Duties (GS-13)
-   Lead projects within the Data Science set of capabilities: data-driven modeling, reproducible workflows, data visualization.
-   Integrate approaches that span the interface between data science techniques and traditional domain-based techniques into priority projects.
-   Strategize and design projects, prototypes, and/or concepts that bring new data science approaches into the USGS-WMA water prediction/assessment projects
-   Implement new and existing data science approaches towards building solutions to areas of need. Can include architecting new data science approaches and/or implementing reproducible automation of existing approaches.
-   Conduct research as needed to support studies and prepare written products to convey research-based knowledge and information to a variety of audiences.

### Relevant Experience (GS -13)
Exercising a wide latitude of independent judgement to: 

plan, lead, and report on complex projects involving physical, hydrologic, biological, natural resources,  
use of a variety of data collection and processing methods, reproducible data pipelines in modern programming languages (e.g., R, Python), data visualization, artificial intelligence / machine learning models, statistical/applied mathematical skills as applied to water resources problems
This work typically involves extensive modification of conventional methods and techniques, without guidelines or precedent, to the problems at hand and interpreting findings in terms of their scientific and/or technical significance. 
At this level, physical scientists have the ability to independently perform scientific work of considerable complexity, breadth, and diversity.

### Relevant Experience (GS-12)
planning and executing complex projects involving physical, hydrologic, biological, natural resources, 
use of a variety of data collection and processing methods, reproducible data pipelines in modern programming languages (e.g., R, Python), data visualization, artificial intelligence / machine learning models, statistical/applied mathematical skills as applied to water resources problems
This work typically involved conventional methods and techniques though it required going beyond clear precedents, and required adapting methods to the problems at hand and interpreting findings in terms of their scientific and/or technical significance. 
At this level, physical scientists have the ability to independently perform scientific work of considerable difficulty.
